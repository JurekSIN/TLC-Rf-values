# TLC-Rf-values
Excel calculator for Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) Rf values of various psychoactive compounds, ranging from tryptamines to cathinones. Based on the amazing work of Endlessness (https://www.dmt-nexus.me/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&t=71113). Using ratios the calculator makes TLC analysis a piece of cake.

"Testing with TLC is easy! Test your substance next to any other substance that is of confirmed identity (if you don't have anything at home you can buy caffeine online or even just soak coffee beans in the provided testing liquid and use that). Then you measure the height of the spot of your known substance (for example caffeine or anything else you have), and then select your unknown substance (the one you suspect what it should be but need to confirm it's identity) from the dropdown list, and the calculator will tell you where your unknown substance should be on the plate." by Endlessness

Repository developed by SIN (https://sin.org.pl) in Poland. Inviting fellow drug checking researchers!

Current release covers following eluents:
97.5% Methanol and 2.5% Ammonia solution (25%) - 134 substances

Ethyl acetate, methanol and (25%) ammonia â€“ (85:10:5 v/v/v) - currently in development

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE?
To take the radio basically you have to make many tests per substance versus caffeine, in order for it to be accurate, at least 5x tests per substance, ideally in different days and then makes an average of their ratio. Otherwise you can make it using another substance then caffeine. For example if you have pure MDMA you can do all substances vs MDMA then you get the substance vs MDMA ratio and calculate what it would be vs caffeine too.
